# Popular Movies - Project #1

This is the first project in the Udacity course for Android Development.
It requires an API Key for accessing The Movies DB . It can be created in [their website](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

After creating an API Key from The Movie DB website, the gradle.properties file should be updated with:
```java
API_KEY = "Your API Key goes here."
```

After that, you should be good to go.
