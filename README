# Udacity Projects

This repository is intended to hold all the projects I develop for the Android Developer Udacity course.

Here I didn't separate each project as a different git project because I wasn't sure if it is necessary. However, if at some point I understand that each project should be a part of a different repository, I will do so. Probably using something like sub-modules, not sure yet.
